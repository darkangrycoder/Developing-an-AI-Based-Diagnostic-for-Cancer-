Title: AI-Based Diagnostic Tool for Cancer Detection

Description: This project aims to develop an AI-based diagnostic tool for cancer detection. The tool will use machine learning algorithms to analyze medical images and patient data, and provide accurate and reliable diagnoses. The project will involve the collection and analysis of large datasets, as well as the development of deep learning models. The final product will be a user-friendly tool that can be used by healthcare professionals to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of cancer, potentially improving patient outcomes and survival rates. The code and documentation for the project will be available on GitHub for others to use and contribute to.
